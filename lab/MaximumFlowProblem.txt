Algorithm 

E number of edge 
f(e) flow of edge 
C(e) capacity of edge 

1) Initialize : max_flow = 0  
                f(e) = 0 for every edge 'e' in E 
            
2) Repeat search for an s-t path P while it exists.   
   a) Find if there is a path from s to t using BFS
      or DFS. A path exists if f(e) < C(e) for 
      every edge e on the path.
   b) If no path found, return max_flow.
   c) Else find minimum edge value for path P
        
      // Our flow is limited by least remaining
      // capacity edge on path P.
      (i) flow = min(C(e)- f(e)) for path P ]
             max_flow += flow
      (ii) For all edge e of path increment flow 
             f(e) += flow

3) Return max_flow
